# About

Clees' Weapon's Refrain (Ultimate) and Unending Coil of Bahamut (Ultimate)
guides are invaluable resources to learn some of Final Fantasy 14's most
difficult fights. Originally hosted on Clees' own site at https://clees.me,
they are reproduced here by [Veraticus](https://github.com/Veraticus) with the
author's permission, given that no advertising is added to the content.

Additionally, ultimates.guide contains original content on how to do DRU properly!

All the guides can be altered on [GitHub](https://github.com/Veraticus/ultimates.guide)!
