### Setup and Strength (Trio 1)

### Trio 2

There are two popular strategies for trio 2 in PF right now: "braindead"
and "brainsmort." Both have relative strengths and weaknesses and PF
has not settled on one yet, so both are presented here.

### Trio 3 (Meteors) to End

https://ff14.toolboxgaming.space/?id=050062490351561&preview=1

This is a spammable macro you can use to do a 4 hour cursed meteor dodge, courtesy of Radrauser@the Balance. It will space meteors at the absolute minimum distance to prevent explosions.

```
/mlock
/merror off
/automove on <wait.1>
/automove off
/echo
/echo
/echo
/echo
/echo
/echo
/echo
/echo
/echo
/echo
/echo
```

Add more /echos to cause the macro to take longer, and less for it to be shorter. Fine-tune it to your FPS. (Though the default seems to work for most people.)
